## Idea

I've been hosting minecraft servers for a while, and I've been thinking... that's a lot of power I have here :3c I control the whole operation! There is a single authority - the server - that has total control. And you know what that sounds like? 

Dictatorship.

So hear me out: what if every client has a say on how things are done? Liberation of the masses.

Obviously you can't run minecraft without a server. And you might say: "But what about single--" there is still a server running, its simply running on the same computer your as the client. You press the "open to lan" button and boom, you're instantly hosting a server, because you were already doing that. This does not work, we need a different approach for the block game.

Wait... block...

## What if blockchain?

No.

## What is a server anyway?

Before I had any knowledge of computer stuff, the concept of a server was rather fuzzy, you're likely to think about some large data-center-esque racks with square boxes and blinking lights and enough wires to strangle a victorian child. In reality a server can be any computer - it describes a function or a role, not a hardware characteristic. But I won't get to it here, the main question is: why are games like Minecraft divided in this way in the first place?

To answer this question, I *don't* need to talk about bitcoin, but you see bitcoin has quite a few flaws that are pretty easy to fix. First of all []

Oh shit, sorry, sorry I accidentally created a bank.

Essentially, people want their emeralds to be secure, and not disappear because XX_leech_XX didn't personally think you had any.

Now it's time to add all the aforementioned problems to minecraft.

## Fine, I guess I will implement the blockchain
